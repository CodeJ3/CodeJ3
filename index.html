            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>
                Abramov was born and raised in Russia. He started coding around the age of twelve with his exploration of Microsoft PowerPoint features. 
                His first programming language was VisualBasic. Two years later he started learning JavaScript, when his step-father requested him to develop a database to track information from photoshoots. 
                Abramov finished high school in 2009 and started University. During the summer after his first year, he began working for DataArt, a US-Russian company. 
                After starting this job he dropped out of University during his second year.

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                He started working at DataArt and spent a month working onsite on a project in New York. 
                In 2011, he quit his job at DataArt and began working for free on a Russian entrepreneur's projects in exchange for free lessons in web development. 
                While working with other volunteers, he learned Git, Python, Django, CSS, and JavaScript. After a failed attempt to work for a Russian social media company, Abramov got a job at Stampsy. 
                While at Stampsy he wanted to contribute to React itself and got in touch with Paul O'shannessy asking if there were any pull requests he could work on.
                In 2014, he also got his first email from a Facebook recruiter, but the logistics of working in America were complicated as he didn't have enough years of experience, and he had dropped out of college.
                In 2015, the company was running out of funding, and Abramov wanted to spend more time working on open-source projects and to give his first conference talk at ReactConf. So Abramov decided to leave Stampy; he found some company using one of his open-source projects, and they agreed to sponsor his work on it for a few months.
